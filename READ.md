This repository contains the files related to Coursera’s “Getting and Cleaning Data” Week 4 Assignment.

This project is related to the field of wearable computing. The data set used for this project is a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The data set for this project can be found at the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you will see a folder named “UCI HAR Dataset”. Save the folder in your working directory.

The code that will perform the analysis is included in the “run_analysis.R” file. Open the file with Studio and run the script.

The script will perform as follows, as indicated in the project summary:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The result of running the script is the “tidy_data.txt” file where you can find a tidy data set as indicated in the step 5 of the course project.
